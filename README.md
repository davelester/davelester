### Hi there 👋

I'm an open source technologist living in the Bay Area, currently fascinated by software package managers and software supply chains. I've previously worked at Google, Apple, and Twitter, and received a master's degree from the UC Berkeley School for Information.

The heart of my professional work has been leading open source initiatives and growing developer communities.
